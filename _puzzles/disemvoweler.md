Being able to find elements in a list and remove them is a computing skill that will pop up many times in your programming career. In this challenge we will work on writing a program that will remove vowels and spaces from a given string.  

## Functions to Add to Your Code Library


```c
//Statically-typed function template for clarity
String removeCharFromString(String input, Char charToGet)
```

Given an arbitray string and a character to look for, remove that character from the string and return the resulting string. 

Examples:

```python
# A few examples to get the point across.
removeCharFromString("Hello world!", 'o') #=> "Hell wrld!"
removeCharFromString("Not creative example", 'z') #=> "Not creative example"
```

## Puzzle

This puzzle focuses on being able to remove characters from a string but also keeping the order of the characters that you remove. If you've completed the previous method you should be able to solve this problem by only modifying it slightly.
