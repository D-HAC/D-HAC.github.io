# It's November!
It is now the month of November, and the focus of this month's theme is going to be "Visuals." We're going to try and have a diverse set of puzzles that focus on making something interactive and/or visually engaging.

## Background
Today, we are going to work to create some ASCII-based animations. If you've never heard of ASCII before, don't worry. It's just a scheme for encoding characters. If you want to read more about it, you can do so [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).

For today's puzzle, we will be taking the ASCII symbols and making animations. Many people have invested time in creating ASCII-art (see [this](http://www.chris.com/ascii/), [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art), and [this](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20) for inspiration). The idea is to be creative and have some pizzazz. Make some ASCII art and then animate it! You have complete freedom with what you want to do.

Some ideas:

* Take your favorite song, play it, and have ASCII bubble text display the lyrics while the song plays
* Create an ASCII character and have it move and/or dance
* Make The Bee Movie script scroll and show in ASCII animation like fashion
* Do something radically different than any of these suggestions because it's all about your artistic freedom today!

## Next Week
Next week, we're going to emphasize showing off what we put together this week. If you make something cool, be proud of what you did!
