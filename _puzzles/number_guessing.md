I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What do you think it is?

I'm sure many of you have played this game before with a friend and today
we're making it so you can play it with your computer.

## Beginner Challenge

Write a program that thinks of a random number and asks the user
to guess what number it is thinking of. If the number that the
user guesses is less than the number the computer is thinking
the program should respond with "Higher". If the number that
the user guesses is greater than the number the computer is
thinking, the program should respond with "Lower". If the player
guesses the right answer the game should end.



Examples:

```
Let's play a guessing game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
What do you think it is?
52
Lower
38
You guessed it!
```

## Advanced Challenge

Instead of guessing what number the computer is thinking reverse the game
so that the computer has to guess the number you are thinking. If the
computer guesses greater than your guess you should respond with "Lower".
If the computer guesses lower than your guess you should respond with "Higher".
If the computer guesses your number you should respond with "You Win!".

Try to come up with a way to have the computer win in 7 guesses or less.

Example:

'''
I guess you're thinking: 70
Lower
I guess you're thinking: 20
Higher
I guess you're thinking: 38
You Win!
'''
