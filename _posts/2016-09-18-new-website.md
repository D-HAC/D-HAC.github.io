We are making a new website for the Drexel Hackathon and Coding Club. This
website will become a useful resource for the club as we tackle many
programming puzzles this year.

We plan to add pages detailing various programming problems but tailored to
students of all levels of programming experience. These pages will be our
resource for club meetings.

This website will likely get a theme change soon, since the default theme
for Jekyll is rather boring.
