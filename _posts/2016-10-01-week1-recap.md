This week, we had our first official D-HAC meeting of the year. We had a
great turnout, enough to overflow the conference room! Over the course
of the next few meetings, we hope to have a better plan for where to hold
our meetings so we have enough space.

The first week, we did programming puzzle about converting different units
(degrees to radians, Fahrenheit to Celsius, etc.)

This coming week, our meeting will be held at the same place and time as
last week. We will be doing a puzzle called the Game of Threes.
