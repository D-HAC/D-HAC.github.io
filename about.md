# What We Do

The core mission of the Drexel Hackathon and Coding club is to give everyone the
opportunity to work on and discuss interesting programming challenges in a risk
and judgement free environment. Each week, our members get together to talk
about code, learn about development through discussion, and ultimately work on
a programming challenge. Our officers have worked very hard to make sure that
each week the challenges are accessible to all developers, regardless of skill
level. So, if you're looking for a club that will let you meet other developers
and work together to solve problems, or one where you can hone your own skills
and get feedback from your peers, you've found the right place.
