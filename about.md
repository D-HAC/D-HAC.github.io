# What We Do

Each week, the lab members tackle a coding challenge in a little healthy
competition (that I have dubbed a "codeoff"). Essentially, the lab members will
race each other to see who can find an efficient solution to the challenge
first. The challenges are fun projects that range in difficulty and can be
solved in any language that the programmer chooses. (These challenges are
usually just taken from /r/dailyprogrammer.) Though this is a competition, lab
members are encouraged to help each other if they are having trouble solving a
small part of the challenge (or debugging some code.) This is all in good sport,
and the overall goal is to just have fun programming and learn something along
the way.
