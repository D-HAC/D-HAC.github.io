# What We Do

<!-- TODO: Update this description -->

The core mission of the Drexel Hackathon and Coding club is to give everyone the oppertunity to work on and discuss interesting programming challenges in a risk and judgement free environment. Each week, our members get together to talk about code, learn about development through discussion, and ultimately work on a programming challenge. Our officiers have worked very hard to make sure that each week the challenges are accessable to all developers regardelss of skill level. So if you're looking for a club that will let you meet other developers and work together to solve problems or one where you can hone your own skills and get feedback from your peers you've found the right place.
