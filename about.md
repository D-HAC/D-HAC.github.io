# What We Do

The core mission of the Drexel Hackathon and Coding club is to give everyone the
opportunity to work on and discuss interesting programming challenges in a risk
and judgement free environment. Each week, our members get together to talk
about code, learn about development through discussion, and ultimately work on
a programming challenge. Our officers have worked very hard to make sure that
each week the challenges are accessible to all developers, regardless of skill
level. So, if you're looking for a club that will let you meet other developers
and work together to solve problems, or one where you can hone your own skills
and get feedback from your peers, you've found the right place.

<!-- Some text to try to get jekyll to rebuild:


    We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell 'em stories that don't go anywhere - like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you'd say.

    Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...
